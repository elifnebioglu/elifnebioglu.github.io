Hi, I’m Elif Nebioglu. I recently completed the Master MVA (Mathematics, Vision, Apprentissage) at ENS Paris-Saclay, where I focused on computer vision, generative modelling, Bayesian image restoration, and geometric data analysis. Before that, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from TOBB University of Economics and Technology as an honor student with a full merit-based scholarship.

I’ve worked in both research and industry through internships at DxO Labs, TOBB ETU, TEMSA, STM, Telecom Paris, and HAVELSAN. My experience includes face detection and segmentation, geometry-based face warping, behavioral video analysis for cognitive research, anomaly detection in electric vehicles, full-stack development, and differentiable computing. I enjoy working at the intersection of mathematical modelling and practical machine learning systems.

Feel free to reach out via email or connect with me on LinkedIn. I am always open to new collaborations!
