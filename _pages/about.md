Hi, I’m Elif Nebioğlu. I recently completed the Master MVA (Mathematics, Vision, Apprentissage) at ENS Paris-Saclay, where I focused on computer vision, generative modelling, Bayesian image restoration, and geometric data analysis. Before that, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from TOBB University of Economics and Technology as an honor student with a full merit-based scholarship, awarded for ranking in the top 0.003% nationally.

I’ve worked in both research and industry through internships at DxO Labs, TOBB ETU, TEMSA, STM, Telecom Paris, and HAVELSAN. My experience includes face detection and segmentation, geometry-based face warping, behavioral video analysis for cognitive research, anomaly detection in electric vehicles, full-stack development, and differentiable computing. I enjoy working at the intersection of mathematical modelling and practical machine learning systems.
